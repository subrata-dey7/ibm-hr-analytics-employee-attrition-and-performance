## **Executive Summary**:

Employee attrition poses a significant challenge for organizations due to increased hiring costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and reduced workforce productivity. This project analyzes the IBM HR Analytics dataset to understand the current employee attrition rate, identify key demographic and job-related drivers, and provide actionable recommendations to improve employee retention.

Using Python for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL for structured analytical queries, and Tableau for interactive visualization, the analysis reveals an overall attrition rate of 16.12%, with higher turnover observed among specific job roles, departments, and employees experiencing low job involvement and work-life balance. Distance from home, compensation structure, and marital status also show measurable influence on attrition patterns.

The findings support data-driven HR decision-making by highlighting high-risk employee segments and suggesting targeted retention strategies.
